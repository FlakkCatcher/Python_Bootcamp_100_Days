# VARIABLES

name = input("What is your name? ")
length = len(name)
print(length)

# Remember that variable naming has to be a single term, can't start with a number, 
#   AND can't use any of the priveledged terms like "print","input", etc.

# Also keep in mind that anything can be a variable name as long as it's consistent
#   throughout the code (see below)

ramalamadingdong = "Bob"
print(ramalamadingdong)
